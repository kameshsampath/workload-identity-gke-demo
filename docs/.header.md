# GKE Terraform Template

A GitHub template that could be used to get started with [Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) using [terraform](https://terraform.build).

## Pre-requisites

- [Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com)
  - With a Service Account with roles to create GKE Clusters
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)
- [terraform](https://terraform.build)
- [helm](https://helm.sh)(Optional)
- [kustomize](https://kustomize.io)(Optional)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net)(Optional)

## Using this Template

On browser navigate to the repo <https://github.com/kameshsampath/gke-tf> and click **Use Template**, follow the wizard to create your repository based on the template.

Using [github cli](https://cli.github.com/)

```shell
gh repo create --public --description="My GKE Demos and Examples" --template https://github.com/kameshsampath/gke-tf my-gke-demos
gh repo clone my-gke-demos

## Environment Variables

When working with Google Cloud the following environment variables helps in setting the right Google Cloud context like Service Account Key file, project etc., You can use [direnv](https://direnv.net) or set the following variables on your shell,

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="the google cloud service account key json file to use"
export CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME="the google cloud cli profile to use"
```

You can find more information about gcloud cli configurations at <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/configurations>.

As you may need to override few terraform variables that you don't want to check in to VCS, add them to a file called `<name>.local.tfvars` and set the following environment variable to be picked up by terraform runs,

```shell
export TFVARS_FILE=<name>.local.tfvars
```

>**NOTE**: All `.local.tfvars` file are git ignored by this template.
