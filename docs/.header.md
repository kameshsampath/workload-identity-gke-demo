# Using Workload Identity

A demo to show how to use [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/workload-identity) to call Google Cloud API. In this demo we will call the [Translate API](https://cloud.google.com/translate) from a GKE application(pod) using Workload Identity.

## Pre-requisites

- [Google Cloud Account](https://cloud.google.com)
  - With a Service Account with roles
    - `Kubernetes Engine Admin` - to create GKE cluster
    - `Service Account User`    - to use other needed service accounts
    - `Compute Network Admin`   - to create the VPC networks
- [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)
- [terraform](https://terraform.build)
- [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [helm](https://helm.sh)(Optional)
- [kustomize](https://kustomize.io)(Optional)
- [direnv](https://direnv.net)(Optional)

## Download Sources

Clone the sources,

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kameshsampath/workload-identiy-gke-demo.git && cd "$(basename "$_" .git)"
export DEMO_HOME="$PWD"
```

## Environment Setup

### Variables

When working with Google Cloud the following environment variables helps in setting the right Google Cloud context like Service Account Key file, project etc., You can use [direnv](https://direnv.net) or set the following variables on your shell,

```shell
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="the google cloud service account key json file to use"
export CLOUDSDK_ACTIVE_CONFIG_NAME="the google cloud cli profile to use"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="the google cloud project to use"
```

You can find more information about gcloud cli configurations at <https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/configurations>.

As you may need to override few terraform variables that you don't want to check in to VCS, add them to a file called `<name>.local.tfvars` and set the following environment variable to be picked up by terraform runs,

```shell
export TFVARS_FILE=<name>.local.tfvars
```

>**NOTE**: All `.local.tfvars` file are git ignored by this template.

Check the [Inputs](#inputs) section for all possible variables that are configurable.
