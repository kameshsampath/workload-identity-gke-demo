### Example
  
An example `my.local.tfvars` that will use a Google Cloud project **my-awesome-project**, create a two node GKE cluster named **wi-demo** in region **asia-south1** with Kubernetes version **1.24.** from **stable** release channel. The machine type of each cluster node will be **e2-standard-4**. The demo will be deployed in Kubernetes namespace **demo-apps**, will use **lingua-greeter** as the Kubernetes Service Account.

```hcl
app_ksa            = "lingua-greeter"
app_namespace      = "demo-apps"
cluster_name       = "wi-demo"
configure_app_workload_identity = false
gke_num_nodes      = 2
kubernetes_version = "1.24."
machine_type       = "e2-standard-4"
project_id         = "my-awesome-project"
region             = "asia-south1"
release_channel    = "stable"
```

> **NOTE**: For rest of the section we assume that your tfvars file is called `my.local.tfvars`
