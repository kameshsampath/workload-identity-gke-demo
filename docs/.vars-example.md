### Example
  
An example `my.local.tfvars` that will use a Google Cloud project **my-awesome-project**, create a two node GKE cluster named **wi-demo** in region **asia-south1** with Kubernetes version **1.24.** from **stable** release channel. The machine type of each cluster node will be **e2-standard-4**.

You may need to update following values with actuals from your Harness Account,

- `harness_account_id`
- `harness_delegate_token`
- `harness_delegate_namespace`
- `harness_manager_endpoint`

> **NOTE**:
> 
> - `harness_manager_endpoint` value is can be found here <https://developer.harness.io/tutorials/platform/install-delegate/>, to right endpoint check for your **Harness Cluster Hosting Account** from the Harness Account Overview page.
> In the example above my **Harness Cluster Hosting Account** is **prod-2** and its endpoint is <https://app.harness.io/gratis>
>

```hcl
project_id                 = "pratyakshika"
region                     = "asia-south1"
cluster_name               = "wi-demos"
kubernetes_version         = "1.24."
install_harness_delegate   = true
harness_account_id         = "REPLACE WITH YOUR HARNESS ACCOUNT ID"
harness_delegate_token     = "REPLACE WITH YOUR HARNESS DELEGATE TOKEN"
harness_delegate_name      = "wi-demos-delegate"
harness_delegate_namespace = "harness-delegate-ng"
harness_manager_endpoint   = "https://app.harness.io/gratis"
```

> **NOTE**: For rest of the section we assume that your tfvars file is called `my.local.tfvars`
